Overview of the game:
"Buzz's Mascot Duel" is a game where Buzz the Yellow Jacket must face UGA's Bulldog in a duel.
Buzz uses nectar balls to attack the Bulldog who uses footballs. If Buzz can land enough shots before the Bulldog does, then he wins.
Otherwise, he loses this duel.

Gameplay:
Buzz can move in 2D space. He can also shoot nectar balls to attack. He can't shoot while another ball is still airborne
(hasn't hit anything yet), so getting closer to the right wall will "increase" his firerate. However, the Bulldog will have an increased firerate with his football as well
if you are too close, so be careful. The Bulldog only moves in an up and down motion and he is slower. He requires 10 hits to lose, while Buzz requires just 3.
